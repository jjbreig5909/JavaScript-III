/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding is when "this" refers to the Javascript global object itself. 
* 2. Implicit binding is one of the most common uses for "this". It is used to refer to the object that a function lives inside of.
* 3. New binding uses "this" as a generic placeholder so that you can use constructors to create new objects. Because it is generic it can take on the identity of whatever new object is specified. 
* 4. Explicit binding is what occurs whenever using .call, .apply, or .bind on a function. In this useage it provides the context for all of the other parameters that go into the function. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
